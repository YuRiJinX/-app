# LearningWords
It's a Swift basic application which intend to help myself learning words as well as to learn Swift language.

It used LeanCloud for online sevices,such as signIn/signUp, downloading pre-setting wordlists to your local database.
And manipulate those wordlists in local by yourself.
It can also make a learn plan for you, thus you can just start your leanring as soon as you turn the application on.

Most importantly, it's the first complete application that i've done by myself.

So just for commemoration, i place it here.
